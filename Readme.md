![It's The Words](https://raw.github.com/mkleucker/itsthewords/master/res/drawable-xhdpi/itsthewords.png)

A small Android programm which implements a simple version of [Flashcards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard) for learning a new language. 

My first Android App ever, therefore it lacks probably everything that is considered "best practice" in the Android world.

Made for the course [MMI2](http://www.medien.ifi.lmu.de/lehre/ws1213/mmi2/) in the Winter 2012/13.
